'''
    If the user somehow intentionally or accidentally closes the browser window 
    after the payment is confirmed but before the form is submitted a payment
    would be processed in stripe but no order will show in database.
    This could result in a customer being charged and never receiving a
    confirmation email or even worse never receiving what they ordered.
    Each time an event occurs on Stripe such as a payment intent being created
    Stripe sends out what's called a webhook sustem can listen for.
    Webhooks are like the 'signals' Django sends each time a model is saved or deleted.
