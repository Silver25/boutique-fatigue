## Testing 

### Manual Testing process

The manual testing of a website can be a simple procedure, involving the access of a web page or application within a controlled setting, systematically navigating through a set of predefined test scenarios, and documenting the results of each test in a spreadsheet. This fundamental method is often utilized by software teams as they first emphasize quality assurance.

Primarily, a foundational understanding of the Python environment and Django templating, along with knowledge of HTML elements and CSS properties, is advantageous for recognizing and resolving potential issues.

**Testing Process:**  
- *Tested Code*:  
- Project was started as a Python code with Django framework to be used for templating and administration of applications  
- After every new function, variable or template tag, testing was provided through checking result with running server

- *Tested Content*: 
- Before adding actual content, inserted some test content into HTML file and run it in web browser to ensure that the code is working as expected.
- *User Interface (UI)*: 
- Verified the layout, visual design, and overall user experience. Checked for consistent formatting, proper image loading, and readability across different screen sizes.
- *Readability*: 
- Examined displayed text (font family, font size, color contrast).
- *Navigation*: 
- Tested all navigation elements like menus, buttons, and links. Ensured they lead to the correct destination pages and function smoothly.
- *Forms & Functionality*: 
- Tested form (contact) to be sure it submit data correctly, provide clear error messages for invalid inputs, and follow expected functionalities, sending data.
- Tested Stripe 'payment intent' with 'print' function, refresh page and get result of the function/view in Terminal:

- *Content Accuracy*: 
- Reviewed all website content for accuracy, grammar, and spelling mistakes. Verified that descriptions and other information are up-to-date and consistent.
- *Responsiveness*: 
- Validated responsiveness of the website loading Dev Tools option of split screen and resized the browser window across different browsers.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
